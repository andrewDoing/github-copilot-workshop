# Scenario: Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number.
# Goal: Demonstrate Copilotâ€™s autocomplete feature for a single function.

def factorial(n: int) -> int:
    # Start typing the implementation and let Copilot suggest completions.
    # For example, type:
    # "if n < 0:" and see if Copilot suggests error handling
    # "if n == 0:" and let Copilot complete the function.
    pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Quick test
    print(factorial(5))  # Expect 120
