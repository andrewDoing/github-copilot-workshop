# GitHub Copilot Exercises

This repo serves as a playground to try out GitHub Copilot.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

- Install python on your machine. [Download from python.org here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Fork this repo if you want to commit your own changes

### Steps

1. Within the python folder, use the following command in your terminal:

`python -m venv venv`

If you don't understand what this does, ask copilot for an explanation!

1. Activate the virtual environment

`./venv/bin/activate.sh` on macos and linux
`./venv/bin/activate.ps1` on windows

## Workshop instructions

Go through each python file and use copilot to write the code. Feel free to make edits as you see fit.

For step 8, use edit mode to do large scale, cross-cutting changes. You need to review the changes before committing them.
